OpenUTD is a student organization dedicated to the use, development, and appreciation of open-source software. We are a community
of programmers, Linux users, tech enthusiasts, and proponents of digital security and privacy. Come join us to learn more about our
club and open-source software (there will be pizza)! Bring your laptop and a flash drive if you'd like our guidance in trying out or
installing Linux. Flash drives will be provided in limited quantity if you don't have your own.
