    <h1>What does API stand for?</h1>
    <p>
      API stands for Application Programming Interface.<br />But what does that
      mean?
    </p>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        An API is a set of rules that define how a program can communicate with
        another program.
      </p>
      <p>Basically that means it's a way you can call code you didn't write.</p>

    <h1>Examples</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>System Libraries (windows.h, glibc)</li>
      <li>User Libraries (ffmpeg, imagemagick)</li>
      <li>Foriegn Function Interfaces (calling C code from Rust)</li>
      <li>Web APIs (SOAP, REST)</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>
        A library is not the same thing as an API. The API is just the interface
        that is used to communicate with the library.

    <p>REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.</p>
    <p>REST is a standard for how web APIs should be designed.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stateless</li>
      <li>Scalable</li>
      <li>Uniform</li>
    </ul>
