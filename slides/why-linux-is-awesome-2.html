            <p>And when I thought "operating system" I thought Windows.</p>
            <p>Therefore, I went into Linux expecting it to be just like Windows.</p>

            <p>I installed a few programs from it's "app store."</p>

            </a> (OS) is software that is responsible for managing how programs access and utilize hardware such as the CPU.<br><br>
            This limits the compatibility of programs between OS's since they may not share the same features or restrictions.<br><br>
